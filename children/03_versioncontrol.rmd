You would never think of labeling a chemical solution or a sample with a name like "ringer_solution_final_final", but you have probably done that with reports and other documents on your computer. And you ended up with problems, didn't you?

Version control is there to avoid that. The same way as you would record the change of your chemical solution on a piece of paper, you shall record the change of your digital documents in a separate document, writing a comment for each new version about what was changed and why. 

The good news is that you do not need to do that by hand, there is a program to help you with the task, it is called `Git`.
